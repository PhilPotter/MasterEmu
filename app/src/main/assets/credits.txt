Also, many thanks to:
unfnknblvbl from SMSPower.org for helping to test the Android TV support and finding many bugs for me to fix.
Fat32 from dsp.stackexchange.org for helping me with a problem I had with the resampling math.
Keith Sinclair from Chicago for helping to test the 512-byte header detection support.

Codebase uses SDL and SDL_image for cross-platform purposes, as it is based upon CMasterSystem, a PC based project of Phil Potter.

Update (3.3.4):

* Modified gradle config slightly and added fix for Android TV remotes.

Update (3.3.3):

* Removed donation button and replaced with a button to go to my website.

Update (3.3.2):

* Updated app icon to match the new store listing icon.

* Modified build process to bundle all native libraries together in the same APK. This simplifies building, as the app is tiny anyway. It also allows usage of V2 signing.

Bug fix (3.3.1):

* Modified MasterEmu to properly handle ROMs with 512-byte header at the start of their data - MasterEmu will now correctly load the ROM data from the right offset.

Changelog for this release (3.3):

* Fixed a bug with how I/O port 3E was disabling main memory in certain cases when it shouldn't. This corrects the behaviour in G-LOC - Air Battle where the game crashes at the end of the first level.

* Replaced in-app purchase donations with a 'BuyMeACoffee' link. Hopefully this will be less pushy to users.

* Open sourced MasterEmu under GPLv3, and placed on GitHub at https://github.com/PhilPotter/MasterEmu
