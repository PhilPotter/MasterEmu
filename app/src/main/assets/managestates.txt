On this page you can import states from a MasterEmu state ZIP file, export all existing states to a state ZIP file, and finally wipe all save states on your device. Remember, one can also delete individual states by loading the relevant ROM, then long-pressing the state itself in the state browser menu when paused (or pressing X/equivalent on your controller). Cheat codes can be managed in a similar way using the onscreen instructions, and these are also backed up and restored using the same file. Also, do not modify the ZIP file with third-party software - it is laid out in a certain way (and with a header file) so that the import routine can verify it properly - modifying it may change the ordering of entries and is not supported.
