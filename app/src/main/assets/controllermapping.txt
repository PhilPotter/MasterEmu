On this page you can setup a custom mapping for physical game controllers which will be used whilst MasterEmu is actually emulating a game. Even the back button can be overridden. The mapping can also be set back to the default. The analogue stick won't respond during remapping, but will ultimately reflect whatever the D-PAD buttons are mapped to.
