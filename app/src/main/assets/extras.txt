I am still planning to implement Mega Drive/Genesis support if there is enough interest in it from users, as well as Yamaha YM2413 FM support. I have built up a lot of support from people over the few years since I put MasterEmu together, and it really means a lot to me to see so many people using the app. Thank you so much for your support :-)
