Thank you for installing MasterEmu. To support the developer, why not pay a small amount below to help fund future development? In addition, this app is now open source software and available on GitHub, so pull requests are equally welcome - check out the repository using the button below.

I am still planning to implement Mega Drive/Genesis support if there is enough support for it, and indeed this is a goal on the donation page. Many thanks for any financial help any you choose to provide, and also for simply using this app. I have built up a lot of support from people over the few years since I put MasterEmu together, and it really means a lot to me to see so many people just using the app :-)
